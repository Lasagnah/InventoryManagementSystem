# Inventory Management System
## Introduction
In this project, I will be designing an Inventory Management System for a retail store. It will be done using the commandline, and will be able to model a store's transactions and generate reports as well. 
## Implemented Functionalities

    * Has an update method, to update the fields of the given item. 
* Inventory class, which represents a set of all of the products in a store. 
    * Has methods to get the price, name, category, count, and ID of a given item, as well as a method to find an item given its name.
